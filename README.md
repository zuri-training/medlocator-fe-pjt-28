## Overview
MedLocator is a web app that help people locate where they can easily buy prescribed drugs instead of walking from a pharmacy store to the other. Pharmacy store owners register on the platform and update their store information daily. People that want to buy drugs search for a specific drug(s) name and the stores that have these drugs around them would pop up.
